# This script is used to process a PBS generated host list for use in
# Linda jobs with Gaussian calculations on the CRC. Two arguments are
# required -- (1) the name of the PBS host file; and (2) the number of
# share-memory processors requested for EACH Linda worker. The output of
# this script is a line that can be used in the Gaussian command-line
# invocation to specify Linda workers.
